            Image quantization is a way to simplify images by reducing the 
            number of colours while keeping them looking the same. This paper suggests a 
            new method that combines two techniques, Social Spider Optimization (SSO) 
            and K-Means clustering, to make this process faster and better image quantiza- 
            tion. SSO is like how social spiders work together to find food. It helps K-Means, 
            which can be slow, get started and finish faster by choosing the right starting 
            points through finding the best centroids. This new way not only speeds things 
            up but also makes the pictures look better. In tests, we tried this SSO-K-Means 
            method on different sets of images and compared it to regular K-Means. The 
            results showed that using modified SSO with K-Means improved image quality 
            and made the process faster. This method could be useful in tasks like image 
            compression, retrieval, and other image jobs where simplifying pictures is im- 
            portant. <br><br>

        <h1 class="heading1">Introduction</h1>
        <p class="para1">
            Image quantization is a basic technique in digital image processing that serves the 
            need of reducing the complexity of an image's colour information while preserving im- 
            age retrieval, and various other image-related tasks. Image quantization typically con- 
            sists of two main steps: colour palette generation and pixel mapping. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The initial step involves creating a limited set of dominant colours, known as a col- 
            our palette. This palette is an important element of the quantization process as it dictates 
            the colours that will be available for representing the image. The palette can contain apredefined number of colours, and these colours are usually chosen to be the most dom- 
            inant ones in the original image. There are several methods to generate colour palettes, 
            including popular techniques like K-Means clustering, Median Cut, and Octree quanti- 
            zation. These methods aim to find an equal mix of colours that capture the required 
            visual characteristics of the image.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            In the next step of image quantization, each pixel in the image is mapped to the 
            nearest colour in the colour palette. This mapping is done by comparing the pixel's 
            original colour to the colours in the palette and selecting the closest match. This ensures 
            that the quantized image retains as much visual fidelity as possible while reducing the 
            total number of unique colours used. The mapping can be achieved through various 
            algorithms and techniques, such as the Euclidean distance or the mean squared error. 
            Once the mapping is complete, the quantized image contains only the colours from the 
            palette, resulting in a more simplified and better representation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We explore image quantization and introduce a new methodology 
            by combining two powerful techniques: Social Spider Optimization (SSO) and K
            Means Clustering. Our ultimate goal is to make quantized image more efficient. This 
            approach can be useful in various applications, such as compressing image, finding 
            images based on their content, dividing images into different parts based on their 
            identity, and analyzing the given image.

        <h1 class="heading1">K-Means Clustering for image quantization</h1>
        <p class="para1">
            K-Means clustering is an extensively used unsupervised machine learning algorithm, essentially applied in data analysis, image processing, and various fields where 
            data or objects need to be grouped into clusters based on their similarities. The core 
            idea behind K-Means is to separate a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters, 
            with K being a user-defined parameter. The process is initiated by selecting K initial 
            cluster centers, often randomly. Each data point is then assigned to the closest cluster 
            center, based on a distance metric like Euclidean distance. After this assignment, the 
            cluster centers are recalculated as the average of all data points in their respective clus- 
            ters. This assignment and re-calculation process is iteratively repeated until conver- 
            gence, which occurs when there's slight change in the data point assignments and clus- 
            ter centers. <br><br>
            <b>2.1 Working of K-Means algorithm</b> <br>
            Input: Upload the image and convert to the required scale (RGB or BGR). <br>
            Initialization: Randomly initialize the centers as per requirement of clusters. <br>
            Clustering: For each pixel of an image calculate the Euclidean distance d from the 
            initialized centroids. Group the pixels based on the calculated distance d to the nearest 
            centers. <br>
            Re-initialization of centroids: After all pixels have been grouped, calculate the new 
            centroids by taking mean of all the points in their respective cluster. <br>
            Convergence: Repeat the above clustering process till we get the minimal solution or 
            for a given number of iterations. <br>
            Clustered Image: After executing all the above steps, finally the quantized image is 
            generated by reshaping the clusters. <br>
            Euclidean distance:
             
            d=‚àö(ùëü1 ‚àí ùëü2)2 + (ùëî1 ‚àí ùëî2)2 + (ùëè1 ‚àí ùëè2)2 <br>
            The Euclidean distance (d) between two colours, represented as (r1, g1, b1) and 
            (r2, g2, b2). <br>
            Mean: (‚àëy‚Ç¨c ‚àëx‚Ç¨c p(X, Y))/k <br>
            p(x,y) represent pixel in that cluster. C represents the new centroid for that cluster which 
            is calculated my taking average of all the pixels in that cluster. k represents number of  
            clusters.

        <h1 class="heading1"> Social Spider Optimization </h1>
        <p class="para1">
            Social Spider Optimization (SSO) [3,4] is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that 
            draws its inspiration from the movement and behavior of social spiders. It was recently 
            been added to the family of nature-inspired optimization algorithms, aiming to solve 
            complex problems in various domains, including image clustering. By mimicking na- 
            ture's teamwork, communication, and adaptability, SSO offers a best and efficient ap- 
            proach to image clustering, making it the most interested area for researchers seeking 
            innovative and effective solutions in the field of image analysis and data organization. <br><br>
             
                <b>3.1 Working of social spider optimization  </b><br><br>
            Random initialization: Spiders are initialized randomly in the sample space according 
            to the required number of clusters: Each spider represents a potential solution. <br><br>
            Population separation and Fitness evaluation: Spiders are classified randomly into 
            male and female spiders. Fitness value for all spiders in the population is calculated by 
            using objective function. Fitness values are computed based on the absolute differences 
             between each spider‚Äôs position and corresponding pixel value.<br><br> 
            Weight calculation and Communication: Weights  are calculated for both male 
            and female spiders and communication about weights is done through vibration opera- 
            tor. Information exchange is the principal mechanism in SSO.<br><br> 
            Grouping Population and Mating: The female population is assigned to a new posi- 
            tion according to random probability factor and vibrations received. The male popula- 
            tion is divided into dominant and non-dominant groups based on their weights. The 
            dominant group participate in mating with female population to produce new spider. If 
            new spider has better fitness value than worst spider in the population, new spider re- 
            places the worst spider. <br><br>
            Convergence: The above process is repeated till minimal solution is obtained or for a 
            given number of iterations to produce best centroids for a given number of clusters. <br><br>

        <h1 class="heading1"> Modified SSO and K-Means for Image Quantization  </h1>
        <p class="para1">
            Incorporating K-Means clustering with SSO, an image clustering technique, the accu- 
            racy can be substantially improved. SSO is responsible for the initial optimization of 
            cluster centers by efficiently searching for the best spots within the input space. This is 
            analogous to how social spiders cooperatively hunt their prey by working together. 
            Through harnessing the power of SSO, we can finalize and examine the positions of 
            cluster centroids to better encapsulate the fundamental structure of the image infor- 
            mation. The resulting clusters are widely regarded as highly refined,  
            <br><br>
            Modified SSO is a sub part of SSO where only half of the process is used for optimizing 
            cluster centres. 
            The process begins with optimizing the starting cluster centers by modified SSO. Af- 
            terwards, K-Means takes over the task of assigning data points to their respective clus- 
            ters by computing the nearest centroid based on feature space distance. This step is 
            crucial because it arranges data points based on their similarities, which is the key to 
            achieving meaningful clustering‚Äôs. A satisfactory clustering solution is achieved 
            through an iterative approach that relies on alternating modified SSO and K-Means. 
            During this approach, modified SSO continues to work on optimizing cluster centers 
            while K-Means works on reassigning data points based on the most recently optimized 
            centroids. This process continues iteratively until clusters stabilize, meaning

            <b>Proposed Methodology   </b><br><br>
            Loading the Image. Initially image file is loaded from specified path and converted to 
            RGB colour format.  <br><br>
            Initializing Constants. Various constants are defined, including for optimization such 
            as number of generations, number of samples etc. <br><br> 
            Initializing spider positions and fitness calculation. Spider positions are initialized 
            randomly and fitness is calculated. Fitness is calculated based on absolute difference 
            between spider position and pixel values. <br><br> 
            Weight Calculation and Best fitness Evaluation. Weights of all spiders are calcu- 
            lated. It is used to determine how much influence each spider has on the movement of 
            other spiders. Best fitness values are stored for each generation.  <br><br>
            Convergence. The above process is repeated till minimal solution is obtained or for a 
            given number of generations and given number of samples to produce best centroids.  <br><br>
            K-Means Clustering. For the given input number of clusters, the positions which have 
            best fitness values are taken as initial centroids for K-Means and clustered image is 
            produced.

        <p class="para3">
            Had explored the productiveness of modified Social Spider 
            Optimization which is a sub part of SSO as one of the valuable methods for optimizing 
            centroids and producing initial centroids in the context of K-Means clustering. 
            Our study shows effectiveness of modified SSO in efficiently finding suitable initial  
            Centroids, contributing remarkably to improving convergence speed and performance  
            of the K-Means algorithm. The experimental results reveal that leveraging modified  
            SSO for centroid optimization leads to improved clustering accuracy.  SSO significantly  
            enhances the quality of initial cluster centers. These optimized starting points facilitate  
            better convergence of the K-Means algorithm and consequently yield more accurate  
            and representative clusters.
